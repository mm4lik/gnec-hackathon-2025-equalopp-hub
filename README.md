## AI Allyship Coach: Empowering Inclusive Action

**Project for the Global NGO Executive Committee (GNEC) Hackathon 2025**
**Theme**: SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities)

---

## üî• Problem Statement

Despite rising global awareness of **gender equality** and LGBTQ+ inclusion, there remains a significant gap between *intentions* and *actions* when it comes to real-world allyship. Many individuals want to support women, trans, and non-binary communities but lack practical knowledge on **how** to do so in everyday situations ‚Äî whether at work, in schools, or in digital spaces.

Biases, both **conscious and unconscious**, continue to influence decisions, behaviors, and policies. Traditional solutions ‚Äî such as one-size-fits-all articles, static workshops, or generic training videos ‚Äî often fail to engage users meaningfully. They do not adapt to an individual's unique knowledge level, cultural background, or specific biases.

Moreover, these approaches rarely offer **interactive practice** or real-time feedback, making it difficult for users to build true competency and confidence as allies.

There is a clear need for a **personalized, AI-powered microlearning tool** that:

* Engages users through interactive scenarios.
* Provides immediate, constructive feedback.
* Evolves based on user progress.
* Equips people with actionable skills to challenge discrimination and foster inclusive environments.

Such a tool can close the knowledge-action gap and empower more people to become effective, everyday allies ‚Äî not just passive supporters.

## üéØ Our Solution: EqualOpp Hub‚Äôs **AI Allyship Coach**

**EqualOpp Hub** introduces the **AI Allyship Coach** ‚Äî an interactive, web-based microlearning platform designed to turn good intentions into meaningful action. It empowers users to build real-world allyship skills through personalized, engaging, and practical learning journeys.

### üå± Key Features:

* **Scenario-Based Training**: Users face realistic workplace, school, and social situations involving gender bias, discrimination, or exclusion. Through interactive scenarios, they practice making inclusive choices in a safe environment.

* **Adaptive Quizzes Powered by AI**: The platform assesses user responses and tailors questions based on their current understanding, making the learning path dynamic and personalized.

* **AI-Powered Feedback Engine**: Users receive immediate, constructive feedback generated by AI. This helps correct misconceptions, reinforce positive actions, and explain the rationale behind better allyship practices.

* **Growth Tracking Dashboard**: A progress tracker shows users how they‚Äôre improving over time ‚Äî measuring not just quiz scores but demonstrated allyship behaviors in scenarios.

* **Microlearning Modules**: Bite-sized lessons designed for busy individuals ‚Äî each module takes 5-10 minutes, encouraging daily engagement without overwhelming users.

### üåç Impact on SDGs:

By targeting **SDG 5 (Gender Equality)** and **SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities)**, the AI Allyship Coach directly contributes to:

* **Empowering users** with knowledge and confidence to challenge biases.
* **Creating safer, more inclusive environments** across workplaces, schools, and communities.
* **Reducing systemic inequalities** through grassroots behavioral change, amplified at scale through technology.

### üõ†Ô∏è Built with:

* **Frontend**: React.js for smooth, modern user experience.
* **Backend**: Python (FastAPI/Flask) framework for scalable AI logic and microservices.
* **Database**: Dockerized solution for portability and team collaboration.
* **AI Engine**: Leveraging lightweight NLP models for quiz adaptation and feedback generation.
* **Security**: Best practices to protect user data and ensure safe learning spaces.

By combining **AI personalization** with **scenario-based microlearning**, EqualOpp Hub‚Äôs Allyship Coach goes beyond theory ‚Äî transforming users into skilled, confident allies who can make a difference in real life.

## üåü Features

* ‚úÖ **AI Quiz Engine**
  A smart quiz system that uses lightweight NLP models to analyze user responses and adapt questions in real-time. Learners get customized quizzes that gradually challenge their weak areas, making training efficient and effective.

* ‚úÖ **Scenario-Based Microlearning**
  Interactive modules where users face realistic gender inclusion challenges (e.g., handling misgendering at work or addressing unconscious bias in hiring). Users pick actions, and AI explains consequences and offers guidance, simulating real-world learning.

* ‚úÖ **Progress Tracker & Allyship Badges**
  A gamified dashboard where users see their growth over time ‚Äî including quiz scores, allyship milestones unlocked, badges earned, and weekly improvement summaries. Encourages continuous engagement.

* ‚úÖ **Secure User Accounts**
  Fully encrypted login and account system. Uses **JWT tokens** for safe session handling and **bcrypt** for password security. Optional OAuth (Google login) can be added for extra ease.

* ‚úÖ **Mobile-Responsive Frontend**
  Designed with **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS** to look great on phones, tablets, and desktops. Fast page loads, smooth animations, and an app-like experience directly in the browser.

* ‚úÖ **Dockerized Deployment**
  Every part of the app (frontend, backend, database) runs in isolated **Docker containers**, making it easy to deploy on any machine or cloud server with zero compatibility issues.

## üîê Security Considerations 

* **Passwords**:
  Encrypted using **bcrypt hashing** with a strong salt factor, protecting against leaks even if the database is compromised.

* **API Protection**:
  Routes are secured with **JWT authentication** ‚Äî users get a token after login that must be presented for protected actions.

* **Input Sanitization**:
  All user inputs (quiz answers, scenario choices, etc.) go through sanitization filters to prevent **XSS** (Cross-site scripting) and **NoSQL injection** attacks.

* **CORS Policy**:
  Configured to accept requests **only from trusted frontend domains** to prevent cross-site hijacking.

* **Rate Limiting**:
  API endpoints are guarded with request caps (e.g., 100 requests per hour per user) to prevent brute force attacks and bot abuse.

---

## ü§ñ AI Implementation (Planned) 

* **Dynamic Quiz Feedback**:
  Using **OpenAI API** (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo) or a local NLP model, the backend generates instant feedback for user answers. Feedback is constructive, explaining why an answer might reflect bias and suggesting better responses.

* **Answer Classification**:
  Small ML models (like **spaCy text classification** or **Sentence Transformers** with cosine similarity) determine if a user's answer is inclusive, neutral, or biased.

* **Personalized Microlearning Suggestions**:
  Based on weak areas (e.g., if a user often struggles with pronoun use scenarios), the AI recommends new micro-lessons tailored to address those gaps.

* **Secure AI Calls**:
  All AI requests are handled **server-side** with user tokens, meaning user privacy is protected and AI APIs can't be abused by outsiders.
